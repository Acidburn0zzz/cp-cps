# ISRG CP and CPS Documents (DRAFT)

This repository contains new Certificate Policy (CP) and Certification Practice Statement (CPS) documents for ISRG / Let's Encrypt. Our goal is to greatly simplify and improve our CP/CPS documents while moving from masters in MS Word to something more accessible.

These documents are under development and may not accurately reflect current ISRG / Let's Encrypt policies or practices. For current CP and CPS documents please see:
